
This folder contains generic implementations of multithreading primitives.
The idea here is to be able to support different implementations under the
hood. Implementations based on boost::thread are provided out-of-the-box.
Implementations based directly on Windows threads could be made available if
they were useful to anyone. Other implementations should be possible.
